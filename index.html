  Hi!<br><br>
  My Name is Nishikaa, a third year Business Technology Management Student 
  at Toronto Metropolitan University persuing a Minor in Marketing.<br><br>So far, in my university career, I
  have been joining student groups and working in their marketing
  departments to enhance overall engagement.

  Currently, I am a Graphic Design Director at TEDxTorontoMetU and I recently
  finished a work term with Fit for Business as Communications
  and Content Creator. These positions have given me experience in Content Creation and Graphic Design.
